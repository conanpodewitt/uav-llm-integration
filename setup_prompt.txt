LLM_PROMPT=User command: {latest_text}\n
Image caption: {latest_caption}\n
Respond with a JSON object in the following format:\n
{{"linear": <value in m/s>, "angular": <value in rad/s>}}.\n
If desired object is stated in caption to be either left or right, turn first.\n
If desired object is stated in caption to be center, drive towards.\n
You may only change linear or angular, not both.\n
Maximum value for linear is {max_linear_speed} m/s.\n
Maximum value for angular is {max_angular_speed} rad/s.\n
Negative angular values bring objects on the right to the center and vice-versa.\n
If target is not in field of view, rotate with positive angular value.\n
